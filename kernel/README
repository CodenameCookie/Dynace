Note that the jumpto assembler code has been commented out of makefile
which would require an assembler which you may not have.  If you have
the appropriate assembler and wish to use the assembler code (dpp
Strategy 1) make sure you uncomment the reference to jumpto.obj

When rebuilding the system from scratch without the top level make it is
necessary to build this directory first.


To rebuild the libraries use:

dmake -d MAKEFILE.DM NEW=1       (the first time)
	or
dmake -d MAKEFILE.DM	         (thereafter)

where MAKEFILE.DM is one of:

M16.DM		Microsoft 16 bit
M32.DM		Microsoft 32 bit
B16.DM		Borland 16 bit
B32.DM		Borland 32 bit
W32.DM		WATCOM 32 bit
S32.DM		Symantec 32 bit

Or use the following for Linux/unix

make -f makefile.unx

The BORLAND_HOME path needs to be edited in B16.DM or B32.DM prior to use.

Debug libraries may be produced as follows:

dmake -d MAKEFILE.DM  DEBUG=1

If you want to build for a different dpp Strategy (like S1) use:
Note that ../include/generics.h must be rebuilt first.

cd ..
dmake -f MAKEFILE.DM  STRAT=-S1 makegens
cd kernel
dmake -f MAKEFILE.DM  STRAT=-S1 newgens  (regenerates the .c files)
dmake -f MAKEFILE.DM  STRAT=-S1

There is also a clean.bat batch file which will clean all the garbage files
or you can use:

dmake -f MAKEFILE.DM  clean


The "port" subdirectory contains a few files which may be helpful if
attempting to port Dynace.
