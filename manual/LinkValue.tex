@section LinkValue Class
@pdfsection{LinkValue Class}
The @code{LinkValue} class is a subclass of the @code{Link} class.  It is
used in conjunction with the @code{LinkList} class in order to manage
arbitrary objects on a doubly linked list data structure.

Like the @code{Link} class, it is used to represent a single link on a
doubly linked list.  However, the @code{LinkValue} class has the
additional capability to store a single arbitrary object at each link.
Therefore, the @code{LinkValue} class may be used without creating a
subclass of it.

This class (@code{LinkValue}) inherits much of its functionality from its
superclass (@code{Link}), therefore, in addition to the specific
documentation on this class please also refer to the documentation of
its superclass.

See the examples included with the Dynace system for an illustration of the
use of the doubly linked list related classes.



@subsection LinkValue Class Methods
@pdfsubsection{LinkValue Class Methods}
The @code{LinkValue} class has only a single class method.  That method
is used to create and initialize new instances of itself.




@pdfsubsubsection {NewWithObj}
@deffn {NewWithObj} NewWithObj::LinkValue
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gNewWithObj(LinkValue, item);

object  item;
object  i;
@end group
@end example
This class method creates instances of the LinkValue class.  @code{item}
is the object to be associated with the new link.  

The value returned is the instance object created (the new link).
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Dispose::Link, DeepDispose::LinkValue}
@end deffn






@subsection LinkValue Instance Methods
@pdfsubsection{LinkValue Instance Methods}
The instances methods associated with the @code{LinkValue} class are used to
link, unlink, move and dispose of particular instances of the
@code{LinkValue} class.  The majority of its linking type functionality
is inherited from its superclass, @code{Link}.








@pdfsubsubsection {ChangeValue}
@deffn {ChangeValue} ChangeValue::LinkValue
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gChangeValue(i, obj);

object  i;
object  obj;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to change the object associated with a link.
@code{i} is the instance of the @code{LinkValue} class, and
@code{obj} is the new object to be associated with it.
Any previous association is simply disassociated (not disposed).

This method returns @code{i}.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Value::LinkValue, NewWithObj::LinkValue}
@end deffn











@pdfsubsubsection {DeepCopy}
@deffn {DeepCopy} DeepCopy::LinkValue
@sp 2
@example
@group
c = gDeepCopy(i);

object  i, c;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create a new instance of the @code{LinkValue} class
which contains a @emph{copy} of the value associated with the link.
@code{DeepCopy} is used to create the copied value.
The new @code{LinkValue} instance is returned.

Note that the new link returned will not be associated with any list.
It will just be an unlinked link.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Copy::Object}
@end deffn











@pdfsubsubsection {DeepDispose}
@deffn {DeepDispose} DeepDispose::LinkValue
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDeepDispose(i);

object  i;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This instance method is used to perform a deep disposal of an instance
of the @code{LinkValue} class.  It does this by calling @code{gDeepDispose}
on the item associated with the link and then calling the link's
superclass to dispose of the @code{LinkValue} instance.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Dispose::Link}
@end deffn








@pdfsubsubsection {StringRep}
@deffn {StringRep} StringRep::LinkValue
@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gStringRep(i);

object  i;
object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to generate an instance of the @code{String} class
which represents the object @code{i} and its value.  This is often used
to print or display a representation of an object.  It is also used by
by @code{Print::Object} (a method useful during the debugging phase of
a project) in order to directly print an object to a stream.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Print::Object, PrintValue::Object,}
@hfil @break @hglue .64in      @code{StringRepValue::LinkValue}
@end deffn









@pdfsubsubsection {StringRepValue}
@deffn {StringRepValue} StringRepValue::LinkValue
@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gStringRepValue(i);

object  i;
object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to generate an instance of the @code{String} class
which represents the value associated with @code{i}.  This is often
used to print or display the value.  It is also used by
@code{PrintValue::Object} and indirectly by @code{Print::Object}
(two methods useful during the debugging phase of a project)
in order to directly print an object's value.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c object  x;
@c object  s;
@c 
@c x = gNewWithPtr(Pointer, NULL);
@c s = gStringRepValue(x);
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{PrintValue::Object, Print::Object}
@end deffn






@pdfsubsubsection {Value}
@deffn {Value} Value::LinkValue
@sp 2
@example
@group
obj = gValue(i);

object  i;
object  obj;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain the object associated with a link.
@code{i} is the instance of the @code{LinkValue} class, and
@code{obj} is the object associated with it.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{ChangeValue::LinkValue, NewWithObj::LinkValue}
@end deffn
