@section DoubleFloat Class
The @code{DoubleFloat} class is used to represent the C language
@code{double} data type as a Dynace object.  It is a subclass of the
@code{Number} class.  Even though the @code{DoubleFloat} class
implements most of its own functionality, it is documented as part of
the @code{Number} class because most of the interface is the same for
all subclasses of the @code{Number} class.  Differences are documented
in this section.






@subsection DoubleFloat Class Methods
The @code{DoubleFloat} class has only one class method and it is used to
create new instances of itself.



@deffn {NewWithDouble} NewWithDouble::DoubleFloat
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gNewWithDouble(DoubleFloat, val);

double  val;
object  i;
@end group
@end example
This class method creates instances of the DoubleFloat class.  @code{val}
is the initial value of the number being represented.  

The value returned is a Dynace instance object which represents the number
passed.

Note that the default disposal methods are used by this class since
there are no special storage allocation requirements.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  pi;

pi = gNewWithDouble(DoubleFloat, 3.14159265358979);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{DoubleValue::Number, Dispose::Object}
@end deffn





@subsection DoubleFloat Instance Methods
The instance methods associated with the @code{DoubleFloat} class provide
a means of changing and obtaining the value associated with an instance
of the @code{DoubleFloat} class.  Most of the @code{DoubleFloat} class
instance methods are documented in the @code{Number} class because of
their common interface with all other subclasses of the @code{Number}
class.  The remainder are documented in this section.




 
@deffn {Round} Round::DoubleFloat
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gRound(i, pl);

object  i;
int     pl;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to round the value represented by @code{i} to
@code{pl} decimal places.  The object returned is the rounded
object passed.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  pi;

pi = gNewWithDouble(DoubleFloat, 3.14159265358979);
gRound(pi, 4);     /*  pi = 3.1416  */
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{DoubleValue::Number, Truncate::DoubleFloat}
@end deffn







 
@deffn {Truncate} Truncate::DoubleFloat
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gTruncate(i, pl);

object  i;
int     pl;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to truncate the value represented by @code{i} to
@code{pl} decimal places.  The object returned is the truncated
object passed.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  pi;

pi = gNewWithDouble(DoubleFloat, 3.14159265358979);
gTruncate(pi, 4);     /*  pi = 3.1415  */
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{DoubleValue::Number, Round::DoubleFloat}
@end deffn
