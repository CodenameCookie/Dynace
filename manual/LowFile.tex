@section LowFile Class
This class is used to encapsulate the standard C low level IO facility.  It
is a subclass of @code{Stream} and enables access to these routines
through an interface which is common to all subclasses of @code{Stream}.

Although this class implements most of its own functionality, it is
documented as part of the @code{Stream} class because most of the
interface is the same for all subclasses of @code{Stream}.  Differences
are documented in this section.


@subsection LowFile Class Methods
The one class method associated with this class is the method used to
open or create a file.




@deffn {OpenLowFile} OpenLowFile::LowFile
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gOpenLowFile(LowFile, name, oflag, pmode);

char    *name;  /*  file name  */
int     oflag;
int     pmode;
object  i;
@end group
@end example
This class method us used to open or create a normal file using the C
low level IO facility.  @code{name} is the file name to be opened and
may also be an instance of the @code{String} class.  The @code{name},
@code{oflag} and @code{pmode} parameters correspond to the local C
library function @code{open}.  The local library manuals can more
completely describe those arguments.  The value returned is an object
which refers to the opened file.  If the file cannot be opened a
@code{NULL} will be returned.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  f;

f = gOpenLowFile(LowFile, "myfile", O_CREAT|O_WRONLY,
                 S_IREAD|S_IWRITE);
@end group
@end example
@sp 1

@end deffn





@subsection LowFile Instance Methods
The instance methods associated with this class are used to read and write
data to the file represented by the instance.

Although this class implements most of its own functionality, it is
documented as part of the @code{Stream} class because most of the
interface is the same for all subclasses of @code{Stream}.  Differences
are documented in this section.





@deffn {DeepDispose} DeepDispose::LowFile
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDeepDispose(i);

object  i;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to close the file associated with the instance and
dispose of the instance.  It performs the same function as
@code{Dispose::LowFile}.  

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Dispose::LowFile, OpenLowFile::LowFile}
@end deffn











@deffn {Dispose} Dispose::LowFile
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDispose(i);

object  i;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to close the file associated with the instance and
dispose of the instance.  It performs the same function as
@code{DeepDispose::LowFile}.  

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1

@end deffn












@deffn {FileHandle} FileHandle::LowFile
@sp 2
@example
@group
h = gFileHandle(i);

object  i;
int     h;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain the file handle associated with @code{i}.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@c @sp 1
@c See also:  @code{}

@deffn {Name} Name::LowFile
@sp 2
@example
@group
n = gName(i);

object  i;
char    *n;  /*  the file name  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain the name of the file represented by @code{i}.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@c @sp 1
