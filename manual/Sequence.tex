@section  Sequence Class
@pdfsection{Sequence Class}
The @code{Sequence} class is an abstract class which serves the
sole purpose of grouping several subclasses which have common
functionality.  There is no specific class or instance methods
directly associated with this class.

The subclasses of this class (@code{LinkSequence},
@code{LinkObjectSequence} and @code{SetSequence}) are used to provide a
convenient mechanism to enumerate (or sequence) through all the
elements of a collection.
