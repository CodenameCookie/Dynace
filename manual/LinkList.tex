@section LinkList Class
@pdfsection{LinkList Class}
Instances of this class are used to coordinate and handle doubly linked
lists as a whole.  It is used with instances of the @code{Link} class
(or one of its subclasses) which represent the individual links of
the list.

The @code{Link} class is a superclass of this class.  See that class
for functionality which is inherited by this class.

See the examples included with the Dynace system for an illustration of the
use of the doubly linked list related classes.


@subsection LinkList Class Methods
@pdfsubsection{LinkList Class Methods}
There is only one class method associated with this class and it is used
to create new instances of the class.







@pdfsubsubsection {New}
@deffn {New} New::LinkList
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gNew(LinkList);

object  i;
@end group
@end example
This class method creates a new and empty linked list object.

The value returned is the instance object created (the new LinkList).
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c object  x;
@c 
@c x = gNew(LinkList);
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Dispose::LinkList}
@end deffn






@subsection LinkList Instance Methods
@pdfsubsection{LinkList Instance Methods}
The instance methods associated with this class perform functions to
add, change, inquire, enumerate and dispose of links associated with the
linked list.  They also provide information such as how many links are
on the list.








@pdfsubsubsection {AddFirst}
@deffn {AddFirst} AddFirst::LinkList
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gAddFirst(i, lnk);

object  i;
object  lnk;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to add a new link to the beginning of the linked list.
@code{i} is the linked list, @code{lnk} is the new link (an instance of
the @code{Link} class or one of its subclasses).

The value returned is the linked list passed (@code{i}).
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{AddLast::LinkList, DisposeFirst::LinkList}
@end deffn










@pdfsubsubsection {AddLast}
@deffn {AddLast} AddLast::LinkList
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gAddLast(i, lnk);

object  i;
object  lnk;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to add a new link to the end of the linked list.
@code{i} is the linked list, @code{lnk} is the new link (an instance of
the @code{Link} class or one of its subclasses).

The value returned is the linked list passed (@code{i}).
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{AddFirst::LinkList, DisposeLast::LinkList}
@end deffn






@pdfsubsubsection {Copy}
@deffn {Copy} Copy::LinkList
@sp 2
@example
@group
c = gCopy(i);

object  i, c;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create a new instance of the @code{LinkList} class
with copies of all the links which were on @code{i}.  These copies
are made via @code{Copy} so any values associated with the link are
the same objects as those on @code{i}.

The new @code{LinkList} instance is returned.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{DeepCopy::LinkList, Copy::Object}
@end deffn













@pdfsubsubsection {DeepCopy}
@deffn {DeepCopy} DeepCopy::LinkList
@sp 2
@example
@group
c = gDeepCopy(i);

object  i, c;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create a new instance of the @code{LinkList}
class with copies of all the links and their associated values which
were on @code{i}.  These copies are made via @code{DeepCopy} so
the values associated with the links are also copied.

The new @code{LinkList} instance is returned.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Copy::LinkList, Copy::Object}
@end deffn













@pdfsubsubsection {DeepDispose}
@deffn {DeepDispose} DeepDispose::LinkList
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDeepDispose(i);

object  i;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to dispose of the linked list and all its associated
links.  The @code{DeepDispose} method is used to dispose of each link
on the linked list.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Dispose::LinkList, Dispose::Object}
@end deffn









@pdfsubsubsection {DeepDisposeAllNodes}
@deffn {DeepDisposeAllNodes} DeepDisposeAllNodes::LinkList
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gDeepDisposeAllNodes(i);

object  i;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to dispose of all the links on a linked list without
disposing of the linked list object itself.  The @code{DeepDispose}
method is used to dispose of the links so all the objects contained on
the links will be deep disposed as well.

This method returns the object passed.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{DeepDispose::LinkList, DisposeAllNodes::LinkList}

@example
@group
i = gDeepDisposeFirst(i);

object  i;
@end group
@end example

linked list @code{i}.  If there is no first link this method simply
returns.

The first link is disposed of by executing the @code{DeepDispose}
method on it.

This method returns the linked list passed.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group

This method is used to change that value by @code{inc}.  It is mainly
used internally to keep the number accurate and would not normally be
used externally.
@c @example

@example
@group
lnk = gRemoveFirst(i);

object  i;
object  lnk;

This method is used to unlink the first link from the linked list
@code{i} and return it.  The link will no longer be linked on the list.
However, the link is not disposed.  If there are no links this method
simply returns @code{NULL}.

This method returns the link removed.
@c @example
@c @group

@pdfsubsubsection {Sequence}
@deffn {Sequence} Sequence::LinkList
@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gSequence(i);

object  i;
object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method takes an instance of the @code{LinkList} class (@code{i})
and returns an instance of the @code{LinkSequence} class (@code{s}).
The link list represented by @code{i} is not effected by this operation.
The link sequence item, @code{s}, is used to enumerate through all the
links in link list @code{i}.  See the @code{LinkSequence} class for
documentation of other methods needed to use @code{s}.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  ll;  /*  linked list    */
object  s;   /*  link sequence  */
object  lnk; /*  one link       */

/*  ll must be initialized previously  */

for (s=gSequence(ll) ; lnk = gNext(s) ; )  @{
        /*  do something with link lnk  */

@pdfsubsubsection {StringRep}
@deffn {StringRep} StringRep::LinkList
@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gStringRep(i);

object  i;
object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to generate an instance of the @code{String} class
which represents the object @code{i} and its value.  This is often used
to print or display a representation of an object.  It is also used by
by @code{Print::Object} (a method useful during the debugging phase of
a project) in order to directly print an object to a stream.


This method obtains the values of each link by calling @code{StringRepValue}
on each link.

@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
