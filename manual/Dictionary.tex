@section Dictionary Class
The @code{Dictionary} class combines the functionality of the @code{Set}
and @code{ObjectAssociation} classes in order to store a collection of
arbitrary key/value pairs.  The key may be any unique Dynace object.
The @code{gHash} and @code{gCompare} generics are used in order to
access and compare the objects.

This class is a subclass of the @code{Set} class and therefore inherits
all of its functionality.

See the examples included with the Dynace system for an illustration of the
use of the @code{Set}/@code{Dictionary} related classes.


@subsection Dictionary Class Methods
There are no class methods for this class.  It inherits the ability
to create instances of itself through its superclass, @code{Set}.



@subsection Dictionary Instance Methods
The instance methods associated with this class are used to add, retrieve
and remove key/value pairs from the @code{Dictionary}.  Note that additional
functionality may be obtained through its superclass, @code{Set}.






@deffn {AddValue} AddValue::Dictionary
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gAddValue(i, key, value);

object  i;
object  key
object  value;    /*  or NULL   */
object  r;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to add a new key/value pair to the @code{Dictionary}
instance (@code{i}).  If an object with the same key already exists in
the @code{Dictionary} it will be left as is and @code{AddValue} will return
@code{NULL}.  If the key/value objects are added @code{AddValue} will
return the @code{ObjectAssociation} instance created to represent the
key/value pair passed.

@code{key} may be any Dynace object.  The @code{gHash} and
@code{gCompare} generics are used to find and compare the various
objects in the @code{Dictionary}.

@code{RemoveObj::Dictionary}
@end deffn










@deffn {ChangeValueWithObj} ChangeValueWithObj::Dictionary
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gChangeValueWithObj(i, key, value);

object  i;
object  key;
object  value;    /*  or NULL   */
object  r;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to change the value associated with an existing
key/value pair to the @code{Dictionary} instance (@code{i}).
@code{key} represents the identity of the pre-existing key/value
pair and @code{value} represents the new value to be associated with
the key.

Normally, this method changes the value part of the association
and returns the previous value which is not disposed.  If
@code{key} doesn't identify a pre-existing association, this method
simply returns @code{NULL}.

@deffn {DeepDisposeObj} DeepDisposeObj::Dictionary
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDeepDisposeObj(i, key);

object  i;
object  key;
object  r;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to remove and dispose of a key/value pair from a
@code{Dictionary}.  If found and removed @code{i} is returned.  If @code{key}
is not found @code{NULL} is returned.

The key, value and @code{ObjectAssociation} used to bind the two are all deep
disposed.

@code{key} may be any Dynace object.  The @code{gHash} and
@code{gCompare} generics are used to find and compare the various
objects in the @code{Dictionary}.

This method is the same as @code{DisposeObj::Dictionary}.

@deffn {Dispose} Dispose::Dictionary
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDispose(i);

object  i;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to dispose of an entire @code{Dictionary}.  It does not
dispose of any of the keys or values but does dispose of all the
associations used to represent the pair.  

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.

@code{DisposeAllNodes::Dictionary}
@end deffn
















@deffn {DisposeAllNodes} DisposeAllNodes::Dictionary
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gDisposeAllNodes(i);

object  i;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to remove all objects in a @code{Dictionary}
instance without disposing of the instance itself.  The objects in the
@code{Dictionary} are simply disassociated from the @code{Dictionary}
instance and are not disposed.

The value returned is always the instance passed.

@deffn {DisposeObj} DisposeObj::Dictionary
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDisposeObj(i, key);

object  i;
object  key;
object  r;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to remove and dispose of a key/value pair from a
@code{Dictionary}.  If found and removed @code{i} is returned.  If @code{key}
is not found @code{NULL} is returned.

The key, value and @code{ObjectAssociation} used to bind the two are all deep
disposed.

@code{key} may be any Dynace object.  The @code{gHash} and
@code{gCompare} generics are used to find and compare the various
objects in the @code{Dictionary}.

This method is the same as @code{DeepDisposeObj::Dictionary}.

@deffn {Find} Find::Dictionary
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gFind(i, key);

object  i;
object  key;
object  r;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to find the instance of the @code{ObjectAssociation} class
which is used to represent the key/value pair stored under @code{key} in
@code{Dictionary} @code{i}.  If @code{key} is not found @code{NULL} is returned.

@code{key} may be any Dynace object.  The @code{gHash} and
@code{gCompare} generics are used to find and compare the various
objects in the @code{Dictionary}.

@group
r = gFindAddValue(i, key, value);

object  i;
object  key;
object  value;    /*  or NULL   */
object  r;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to find and return the instance of the
@code{ObjectAssociation} class used to represent the key/value pair stored
under the key @code{key}.  If it is not found a new @code{ObjectAssociation} will be
added and returned which represent the key/value pair representing
@code{key} and @code{value}.

@code{key} may be any Dynace object.  The @code{gHash} and
@code{gCompare} generics are used to find and compare the various
objects in the @code{Dictionary}.

This method is used to find the value stored under @code{key} in
@code{Dictionary} @code{i}.  If @code{key} is not found @code{NULL} is
returned.

@code{NULL} is returned.

The key and value are not disposed, however, the @code{ObjectAssociation} used
to bind the two is.
