@section ObjectPool Class
The @code{ObjectPool} class provides a means to group arbitrary objects in a pool.
This pool may later be disposed causing all the objects contained in the pool to
be disposed as well.  This is useful when running a particular functional module.
All the new objects can be added to a pool and then disposed en-mass when the functional
unit is complete.  This makes object disposal a little easier to organize.

This class can maintain numerous pools as well as global pools.

@subsection ObjectPool Class Methods
Class methods for this class are used to create new pools as well as manage global pools.





@deffn {New} New::ObjectPool
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gNew(ObjectPool);

object  i;
@end group
@end example
This class method creates instances of the ObjectPool class.  It is usually
only used by subclasses of the @code{ObjectPool} class.  The new link
will not point to anything.  It will just be an empty link.

This method is actually just inherited from @code{Object} in order
to create a null link.

The value returned is the instance object created (the new link).
