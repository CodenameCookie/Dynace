@section Constant Class
This class is used to represent constants.  Constants are objects which
can never be destroyed or copied.  They always retain their value and
when compared, they only equal themselves.  An example of a constant
would be an object which represents a true or false condition such
as @code{T} and @code{NIL} in lisp.

@subsection Constant Class Methods
There are no specific class methods associated with this class.  The
default instance creation method (@code{New}) is used.


@subsection Constant Instance Methods
The instance methods associated with this class are used to override
certain default methods in order to insure the ``constant'' status
of instances of this class.











@deffn {Copy} Copy::Constant
@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gCopy(s)

object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method performs no function and returns the value passed.  Its only
use is to insure that there is only one copy of any particular instances
of the @code{Constant} class.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@c @sp 1
@c See also:  @code{}
@end deffn












@deffn {DeepCopy} DeepCopy::Constant
@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gDeepCopy(s)

object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method performs no function and returns the value passed.  Its only
use is to insure that there is only one copy of any particular instances
of the @code{Constant} class.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@c @sp 1
@c See also:  @code{}
@end deffn







@deffn {DeepDispose} DeepDispose::Constant
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDeepDispose(s)

object  s;
object  r;
@end group
@end example
This method performs no function and returns the value passed.  Its only
use is to insure the undelete-ability of instances of the
@code{Constant} class.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@c @sp 1
@c See also:  @code{}
@end deffn












@deffn {Dispose} Dispose::Constant
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDispose(s)

object  s;
object  r;
@end group
@end example
This method performs no function and returns the value passed.  Its only
use is to insure the undelete-ability of instances of the
@code{Constant} class.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@c @sp 1
@c See also:  @code{}
@end deffn








@deffn {Equal} Equal::Constant
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gEqual(s, t)

object  s;
object  t;
int     r;
@end group
@end example
This method checks for the equality of two objects (@code{s} and @code{t}).
If they are the same constant a 1 is returned and 0 otherwise.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@c @sp 1
@c See also:  @code{}
@end deffn
