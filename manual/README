The Dynace manual is approximately 320 pages and the WDS manual is
approximately 232 pages.

The manuals have been prepared for standard 8.5x11 inch paper and are
correctly formatted for double sided printing.

There are two tables of contents associated with each manual which gets
printed last.  These pages should be moved to the front of the
manuals (immediately following the cover).

The following file extensions are used:
