@section Link Class
The @code{Link} class is used to represent a single link in a doubly
linked list.  It is normally used in conjunction with the
@code{LinkList} class in order to manage arbitrary objects on a doubly
linked list data structure.

Since instances of the @code{Link} class only contain enough information
to describe the link, the @code{Link} class can be thought of as an
abstract class.  It is never used by itself (instances of it are never
created).  Instead a new class would be created which would have the
@code{Link} class as a superclass.  This new class would describe
the data items which would be stored at each link.  The @code{Link}
class would keep track of its place in the linked list.

The @code{Link} class also has a subclass called @code{LinkValue} which
allows a single arbitrary object to be stored at each link.

See the examples included with the Dynace system for an illustration of the
use of the doubly linked list related classes.


@subsection Link Class Methods
The @code{Link} class has only a single class method.  That method is used
to create and initialize new instances of itself.




@deffn {New} New::Link
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gNew(Link);

object  i;
@end group
@end example
This class method creates instances of the Link class.  It is usually
only used by subclasses of the @code{Link} class.  The new link
will not point to anything.  It will just be an empty link.

This method is actually just inherited from @code{Object} in order
to create a null link.

The value returned is the instance object created (the new link).
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Dispose::Link}
@end deffn





@subsection Link Instance Methods
The instances methods associated with the @code{Link} class are used to
link, unlink, move and dispose of particular instances of the
@code{Link} class or (more often) one of its subclasses.
















@deffn {AddAfter} AddAfter::Link
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gAddAfter(i, lnk);

object  i;
object  lnk;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to insert a new link (@code{lnk}) after another
link (@code{i}) on the linked list which link @code{i} is on.  In order
to accomplish this it modifies pointers in link @code{i}, link
@code{lnk} and the link (if any) which is after link @code{i} in
the associated linked list structure.

Link @code{lnk} must not already be a member of another list.

This method returns its first argument.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{AddBefore::Link}
@end deffn







@deffn {AddBefore} AddBefore::Link
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gAddBefore(i, lnk);

object  i;
object  lnk;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to insert a new link (@code{lnk}) before another
link (@code{i}) on the linked list which link @code{i} is on.  In order
to accomplish this it modifies pointers in link @code{i}, link
@code{lnk} and the link (if any) which is prior to link @code{i} in
the associated linked list structure.

Link @code{lnk} must not already be a member of another list.

This method returns its first argument.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1

@deffn {ChangeNext} ChangeNext::Link
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gChangeNext(i, nxt);

object  i;
object  nxt;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to change the next pointer of a particular link
represented by instance @code{i}.  @code{nxt} is the link to be pointed
to or @code{NULL}.  This method does not effect the instance pointed to
by @code{nxt}.

This method returns the link passed in its first argument.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{ChangePrevious::Link, Next::Link}
@end deffn





@deffn {ChangePrevious} ChangePrevious::Link
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gChangePrevious(i, prev);

object  i;
object  prev;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to change the previous link pointer of a particular
link represented by instance @code{i}.  @code{prev} is the link to be
pointed to or @code{NULL}.  This method does not effect the instance
pointed to by @code{prev}.

This method returns the link passed in its first argument.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{ChangeNext::Link, Previous::Link}
@end deffn







@deffn {Copy} Copy::Link
@sp 2
@example
@group
c = gCopy(i);

object  i, c;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create a new object which is of the same type as
its argument.  However, the new link will not point to the same links.
It will be uninitialized.

The new object is returned.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c object  x, y;
@c 
@c x = gNew(LinkList, 101);
@c y = gCopy(x);
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1

@deffn {DeepCopy} DeepCopy::Link
@sp 2
This method performs the same function as @code{Copy::Link}.
@end deffn











@deffn {DeepDispose} DeepDispose::Link
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDeepDispose(i);

object  i;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to unlink and dispose of a link object.
It performs the same function as the @code{Dispose} method.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1

object  i;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to unlink and dispose of a link object.
It performs the same function as the @code{DeepDispose} method.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.

object  lnk;
object  lst;
object  prev;
object  nxt;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to initialize a link.  @code{lst} is the list it will
be associated with and @code{prev} and @code{nxt} are used to initialize
the link pointers.  Each argument must either be a link or @code{NULL}.

The link passed is returned.

@example
@group
lst = gList(i);

object  i;
object  lst;

object  i;
object  lnk;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to unlink an arbitrary (located anywhere on the
list) link (@code{i}) from any list and relink it immediately after link
@code{lnk} which may be on the same or a different list.  If link
@code{i} wasn't originally on a list, it will simply be added after
link @code{lnk}.

Link @code{i} is returned.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1

i = gMoveBefore(i, lnk);

object  i;
object  lnk;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to unlink an arbitrary (located anywhere on the
list) link (@code{i}) from any list and relink it immediately before link
@code{lnk} which may be on the same or a different list.  If link

@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gMoveBeginning(i);

object  i;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to unlink an arbitrary (located anywhere on the
list) link and relink it at the beginning of the linked list it's
associated with.  

The object passed is returned unless the link was not on a list.  In
that case @code{NULL} will be returned.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1

@deffn {MoveEnd} MoveEnd::Link
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gMoveEnd(i);

object  i;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to unlink an arbitrary (located anywhere on the
list) link and relink it at the end of the linked list it's
associated with.  

The object passed is returned unless the link was not on a list.  In
that case @code{NULL} will be returned.

@group
nxt = gNext(i);

object  i;
object  nxt;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain the link following the link represented by
@code{i}.   If no next link exists, @code{NULL} will be returned.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c

@deffn {Nth} Nth::Link
@anchor{Nth}
@sp 2
@example
@group
nxt = gNth(lnk, idx);

object  lnk;
int     idx;
object  nxt;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to provide a mechanism to index into a linked list
in a manner similar to an array.  If @code{idx} is positive this method
returns the link which is @code{idx} links after @code{lnk}.  If @code{idx}
is negative this method returns the link which is @code{idx} links prior to
@code{lnk}.  If @code{idx} is zero @code{lnk} is returned, and if @code{idx}
represents a position beyond the end of the list @code{NULL} is returned.

@sp 2
@example
@group
prev = gPrevious(i);

object  i;
object  prev;

@deffn {Remove} Remove::Link
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gRemove(i);

object  i;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to remove a link (@code{i}) from a linked list.  In
addition to effecting link @code{i}, it also effects the pointers
associated with the links which link @code{i} points to in its next and
previous pointers (which may be NULL) to make the removal complete.

This method should have no effect on a link which is not on a list.

This method returns the link passed.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1

@deffn {StringRep} StringRep::Link
@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gStringRep(i);

object  i;
object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to generate an instance of the @code{String} class
which represents the object @code{i} and its value.  This is often used
to print or display a representation of an object.  It is also used by
by @code{Print::Object} (a method useful during the debugging phase of
a project) in order to directly print an object to a stream.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group

@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gStringRepValue(i);

object  i;
object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to generate an instance of the @code{String} class
which represents the value associated with @code{i}.  This is often
used to print or display the value.  It is also used by
@code{PrintValue::Object} and indirectly by @code{Print::Object}
(two methods useful during the debugging phase of a project)
in order to directly print an object's value.
@example
@group
