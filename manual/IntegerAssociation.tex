@section IntegerAssociation Class
@pdfsection{IntegerAssociation Class}
This class is a subclass of @code{Association} and is used to represent
an association between a C language @code{int} and an arbitrary Dynace
object.  It performs all the functions as the @code{LookupKey} and
@code{ObjectAssociation} classes and is used in conjunction with the
@code{Set} and @code{Dictionary} classes.  The purpose of this class is
to provide an efficient mechanism to form a common association.


See the examples included with the Dynace system for an illustration of the
use of the @code{Set}/@code{Dictionary} related classes.

@subsection IntegerAssociation Class Methods
@pdfsubsection{IntegerAssociation Class Methods}
The only class method associated with this class is one needed to create
new instances of itself.






@pdfsubsubsection {NewWithIntObj}
@deffn {NewWithIntObj} NewWithIntObj::IntegerAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gNewWithIntObj(IntegerAssociation, key, val);

int     key;
object  val;    /*  or NULL   */
object  i;
@end group
@end example
This class method creates instances of the @code{IntegerAssociation}
class.  @code{key} is used to initialize the key associated with the
instance created and @code{val} is used to initialize its associated
value.

The new instance is returned.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@c @sp 1
@c See also:  @code{}
@end deffn



@subsection IntegerAssociation Instance Methods
@pdfsubsection{IntegerAssociation Instance Methods}
The instance methods associated with this class are used to obtain,
change and print the key and value associated with the instance.
Additional functionality, although implemented by this class, is documented
in @code{IntegerAssociation}'s superclass, @code{Association}.  This is done
because of the common interface these methods share with all subclasses
of @code{Association}.












@pdfsubsubsection {ChangeIntKey}
@deffn {ChangeIntKey} ChangeIntKey::IntegerAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gChangeIntKey(i, key);

object  i;
int     key;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to change the key associated with instance @code{i}.
@code{key} is the new key.  The old key is simply replaced.  This method
returns @code{i}.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{IntKey::IntegerAssociation,}
@hfil @break @hglue .64in      @code{ChangeValue::IntegerAssociation}
@end deffn











@pdfsubsubsection {ChangeValue}
@deffn {ChangeValue} ChangeValue::IntegerAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
old = gChangeValue(i, val);

object  i;
object  val;    /*  or NULL   */
object  old;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to change the value associated with
@code{i} to a value, @code{val}.  The old
value is simply no longer associated with the instance.  It is not
disposed.  This method returns the old value being replaced.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Value::IntegerAssociation,}
@hfil @break @hglue .64in      @code{ChangeIntKey::IntegerAssociation}
@end deffn










@pdfsubsubsection {DeepCopy}
@deffn {DeepCopy} DeepCopy::IntegerAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
c = gDeepCopy(i);

object  i, c;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create a new instance of the
@code{IntegerAssociation} class which contains a @emph{copy} of the value
from the original @code{IntegerAssociation}.  @code{DeepCopy} is used to
create the copy of the value.  The new @code{IntegerAssociation} instance
is returned.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Copy::Object}
@end deffn













@pdfsubsubsection {DeepDispose}
@deffn {DeepDispose} DeepDispose::IntegerAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDeepDispose(i);

object  i;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to dispose of a @code{IntegerAssociation} instance.
It also disposes of the value associated with the instance by the
use of its @code{DeepDispose} method.

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Dispose::Object}
@end deffn


















@pdfsubsubsection {IntKey}
@deffn {IntKey} IntKey::IntegerAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
key = gIntKey(i);

object  i;
int     key;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain the integer key associated with instance @code{i}.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{ChangeIntKey::IntegerAssociation}
@end deffn









@pdfsubsubsection {StringRepValue}
@deffn {StringRepValue} StringRepValue::IntegerAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gStringRepValue(i);

object  i;
object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to generate an instance of the @code{String} class
which represents the value associated with @code{i}.  This is often
used to print or display the value.  It is also used by
@code{PrintValue::Object} and indirectly by @code{Print::Object}
(two methods useful during the debugging phase of a project)
in order to directly print an object's value.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c object  x;
@c object  s;
@c 
@c x = gNewWithPtr(Pointer, NULL);
@c s = gStringRepValue(x);
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{PrintValue::Object, Print::Object}
@end deffn










@pdfsubsubsection {Value}
@deffn {Value} Value::IntegerAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
val = gValue(i);

object  i;
object  val;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain the value associated with
@code{i}.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
