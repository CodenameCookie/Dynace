@section ObjectAssociation Class
@pdfsection{ObjectAssociation Class}
This class is a subclass of the @code{LookupKey} class.  It is used to
associate a value (an arbitrary object) with a key.  The documentation
on the @code{LookupKey} should be consulted since much of this class's
functionality is inherited from it.


See the examples included with the Dynace system for an illustration of the
use of the @code{Set}/@code{Dictionary} related classes.


@subsection ObjectAssociation Class Methods
@pdfsubsection{ObjectAssociation Class Methods}
The only class method associated with this class is the one used to
create instances of the @code{ObjectAssociation} class.





@pdfsubsubsection {NewWithObjObj}
@deffn {NewWithObjObj} NewWithObjObj::ObjectAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
i = gNewWithObjObj(ObjectAssociation, key, val);

object  key;    /*  or NULL   */
object  val;    /*  or NULL   */
object  i;
@end group
@end example
This class method creates instances of the @code{ObjectAssociation} class.
@code{key} is used to initialize the key associated with the instance
created and @code{val} is used to initialize its associated value.  The
new instance is returned.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@c @sp 1
@c See also:  @code{}
@end deffn




@subsection ObjectAssociation Instance Methods
@pdfsubsection{ObjectAssociation Instance Methods}
The instance methods associated with this class are used to obtain,
change and print the value associated with its instances.  Much
additional functionality is achieved through its superclass,
@code{LookupKey}.







@pdfsubsubsection {ChangeValue}
@deffn {ChangeValue} ChangeValue::ObjectAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
old = gChangeValue(i, val);

object  i;
object  val;    /*  or NULL   */
object  old;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to change the value associated with @code{ObjectAssociation}
@code{i} to a value, @code{val}.  The old value is simply no longer
associated with the instance.  It is not disposed.  This method
returns the old value being replaced.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Value::ObjectAssociation, ChangeKey::LookupKey}
@end deffn




@pdfsubsubsection {DeepCopy}
@deffn {DeepCopy} DeepCopy::ObjectAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
c = gDeepCopy(i);

object  i, c;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create a new instance of the
@code{ObjectAssociation} class which contains a @emph{copy} of the key
and value from @code{i}.  @code{DeepCopy}
is used to create the copy of the key and value.  The new
@code{ObjectAssociation} instance is returned.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{Copy::Object}
@end deffn











@pdfsubsubsection {DeepDispose}
@deffn {DeepDispose} DeepDispose::ObjectAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDeepDispose(i);

object  i;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to dispose of the instance passed as well as
associated key and value.  The key and value are disposed of by using
the @code{DeepDispose} method.  

The value returned is always @code{NULL} and may be used to null out
the variable which contained the object being disposed in order to
avoid future accidental use.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{DeepDispose::LookupKey}
@end deffn








@pdfsubsubsection {StringRepValue}
@deffn {StringRepValue} StringRepValue::ObjectAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
s = gStringRepValue(i);

object  i;
object  s;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to generate an instance of the @code{String} class
which represents the value associated with @code{i}.  This is often
used to print or display the value.  It is also used by
@code{PrintValue::Object} and indirectly by @code{Print::Object}
(two methods useful during the debugging phase of a project)
in order to directly print an object's value.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c object  x;
@c object  s;
@c 
@c x = gNewWithPtr(Pointer, NULL);
@c s = gStringRepValue(x);
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{PrintValue::Object, Print::Object}
@end deffn










@pdfsubsubsection {Value}
@deffn {Value} Value::ObjectAssociation
@sp 2
@example
@group
val = gValue(i);

object  i;
object  val;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to obtain the value associated with
@code{i}.
@c @example
@c @group
@c @exdent Example:
@c 
@c @end group
@c @end example
@sp 1
See also:  @code{ChangeValue::ObjectAssociation, Key::LookupKey}
