@section BTree Class
@pdfsection{BTree Class}
The @code{BTree} class provides a means to hold a group of key / value
pairs in a collection.  Objects in a @code{BTree} collection can then be
rapidly accessed arbitrarily (as in hash tables) as well as retrieved in
a specific sequence (as in an ordered linked lists).  Keys and values
may be arbitrary Dynace objects.

It is important that the key objects correctly respond to @code{gCopy}
and @code{gDeepCopy} because copies of the keys are used within the key
structure.

@subsection BTree Class Methods
@pdfsubsection{BTree Class Methods}
The only class method used in this class is one to create instances of itself.



@pdfsubsubsection {New}
@deffn {New} New::BTree
@sp 2
@example
@group
bt = gNew(BTree);

object  bt;
@end group
@end example
This class method creates instances of the @code{BTree} class.

@c @group

@subsection BTree Instance Methods
@pdfsubsection{BTree Instance Methods}
The instance methods associated with this class are used to add, remove,
and retrieve key / value pairs.





@pdfsubsubsection {AddValue}
@deffn {AddValue} AddValue::BTree
@sp 2
@example
@group
old = gAddValue(bt, key, val);

object  bt;
object  key;
object  val;
object  old;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to add an arbitrary key / value pair to BTree
@code{bt}.  Both @code{key} and @code{val} may be arbitrary Dynace
objects.

By default the built in generic @code{gCompare} is used for all key comparisons.
This may be over written via @code{gSetFunction::BTree}.

Each key added to a particular @code{BTree} must be unique
(i.e. duplicate keys are not allowed).

@code{AddValue} normally returns @code{NULL}.  However, if @code{NULL}
is not returned then it means that the key / value pair just added
replaced a similar key / value pair.  In that case the old value
associated with the key will be returned and the old key object will
still be used.  This will normally mean you will have to dispose of
the old value returned and your new key (since the old one was used).
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  key = gNewWithStr(String, "My Key");
object  val = gNewWithStr(String, "My Value");
object  old = gAddValue(bt, key, val);
if (old) @{
        gDispose(key);
        gDispose(old);
@}
@end group
@end example
@c @sp 1

@pdfsubsubsection {DeepDispose}
@deffn {DeepDispose} DeepDispose::BTree
@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDeepDispose(bt);

object  bt;
object  r;     /*  NULL  */
@end group
@end example
This method is used to @code{DeepDispose} all key / value pairs
associated with the @code{BTree} and then dispose of @code{bt} itself.

r = gDeepDisposeAllNodes(bt);

object  bt;
object  r;

@sp 2
@example
@group
r = gDeepDisposeObj(bt, key);

object  bt;
object  key;
object  r;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to @code{DeepDispose} a specific key / value pair
associated with the @code{BTree}.  The key / value pair is determined by
@code{key}.  If the key / value pair was found and removed,
@code{gDeepDisposeObj} will return non-@code{NULL}.  If the key was not
found then @code{NULL} is returned.

The object associated with a key which compares equally with @code{key}
is returned.  If none is found @code{NULL} is returned.

@group
val = gFindNext(bt, fkey);

object  bt;
object  *fkey;
object  val;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to retrieve a key / value pair which comes
immediately after the key pointed to by @code{fkey}.  If @code{fkey}
points to @code{NULL} than the first key / value pair is retrieved.  If
none is found @code{NULL} is returned.

@code{fkey} will be updated to point to the key associated to the value
returned.  It may be used on subsequent calls to @code{gFindNext}.

@sp 2
@example
@group
f = gSetFunction(bt, fun);

object  bt;
int     (*fun)(object, object);
object  (*f)();
@end group
@end example
Normally, the @code{BTree} class uses the generic function
@code{gCompare} for all its key comparisons.  With @code{gSetFunction}
you may override this behavior and specify an alternative generic (or
regular C) function to call.  See @code{Compare::String} for details
on the semantics of that function.

@code{gSetFunction} returns the previous compare function set.
