@section  ShortArray Class
@pdfsection{ShortArray Class}
This class, which is a subclass of @code{NumberArray}, is used to
represent arbitrary shaped arrays of the C language @code{short} data
type in an efficient manner.  Although this class implements much of its
own functionality most of it is documented within the @code{NumberArray}
and @code{Array} classes because the interface is shared by all
subclasses of the @code{NumberArray} class.

@subsection ShortArray Class Methods
@pdfsubsection{ShortArray Class Methods}
There is only one class method which is particular to this class.








@pdfsubsubsection {Iota}
@deffn {Iota} Iota::ShortArray
@sp 2
@example
@group
ary = gIota(ShortArray, n);

object    ary;
int       n;
@end group
@end example
This method is used to create a @code{ShortArray} which has 1 dimension
of length @code{n}.  The first element is initialized with the value
set by @code{IndexOrigin::Array} and each successive element is given
a value one greater than the previous element.

The value returned is the new array.
@example
@group
@exdent Example:

object  ary;

ary = gIota(ShortArray, 5);
/*  ary = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)  */
@end group
@end example
@sp 1
