All packages associated with this system have one of the following
file extensions:

.zip		pkzip format

.tar.gz		unix tar / GNU gzip format

.tgz		unix tar / GNU gzip format

For those who don't currently have GNU gzip it can be obtained at:
ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/gzip-1.2.4.tar
This utility has a much better compression ratio then "compress",
is very portable and doesn't suffer from the patent problems associated
with "compress".

All archive formats include directory paths relative to wherever your
Dynace root is contained.  You should, therefore, change to wherever
your Dynace root is and then unpack it, including directories.

After unpacking the stuff you'll want to see the README.txt or
docs/README.txt file for further information.

The following gives unpacking examples for the various formats.
It is assumed that your Dynace root is /dynace.  This can be changed to
whatever you like.

DOS/Windows with pkunzip
------------------------

	md \dynace
	cd \dynace

	pkunzip -d file.zip   (repeat this line for each .zip file - be sure
	                       to always start from \dynace)

See BUILD.txt for instructions on building the system


DOS/Windows with unzip
----------------------

	md \dynace
	cd \dynace

	unzip file.zip        (repeat this line for each .zip file - be sure
	                       to always start from \dynace)

See BUILD.txt for instructions on building the system


Linux/Unix
----------

	mkdir /dynace
	cd /dynace

	gzip -dc file.tar.gz |tar xvf -    (repeat this line for each file -
	                                    be sure to always start from
	                                    /dynace)
