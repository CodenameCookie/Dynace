Please note that Dynace comes with extensive documentation.  Once you
have the system built (following instructions in this file), see:

	manual/Dynace.pdf - 300+ pages of documentation on the language

	manual/WDS.pdf - 300+ pages of documentation on the Windows
	                 development system

	manual/odbcusr.pdf - documentation on the SQL interface

The system also comes with a language tutorial.  See:

	examples/exam01/readme

Then there is a Windows development system tutorial at:

	winexam/exam01/readme

(The Windows development System uses the WIN32 API.  It operates under
Windows but also operates under Mac and Linux using Wine (the Win32
API for Unix))


----------------------------------------


Build instructions:

There are four sections labeled:
     Windows
    Linux, Apple Mac, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Cygwin under Windows
    Plan 9
    Minix

The DOS port should still work but is no longer tested.

The system runs fine under 32 and 64 bit Linux as well as 64 bit Mac.
While the system has been tested under 32 bit Windows, 64 bit Windows
has not been tested.  It should run fine with possible minor tweaks to
the makefiles.

Assuming DR is your Dynace root directory such as  c:\dynace

Go to the appropriate section.


================================================================================

Windows
-------

If you are operating With Cygwin under Windows, use the Linux build
docs below rather than this secion.

Dynace is build from the command line using the included DMAKE
program.  DMAKE is just an enhanced nmake or make program.

First make sure that your command line compiler is set up correctly.
You can do this by using the "Visual Studio Command Prompt" that comes
with Visual Studio and is located under "Visual Studio Tools".  I
suggest that you create a "Hello, World" program and compile and link
it from the command line to be sure it's all set up correctly.

1.  Make sure you copy the exe files from bin\win32 to the bin directory:

	copy  bin\win32\*  bin  

2.  Next, goto the DR (Remember DR is the location where you unzipped
Dynace) directory and if you are operating under the DOS or Windows
3.1 OS you should edit the file named 16bit.bat.  Otherwise, edit
32bit.bat.  The file will tell you what to do.

IMPORTANT!: Make sure you edit the 32bit.bat file as described in the
previous paragraph.  If you don't have the MAKESTARTUP environment
variable setup the system won't build.

3.  Next execute the file you just edited by typing:

	16bit
	 or
	32bit

4.  Build the system

The following table indicates the correct makefile for each supported
environment: (note:  only M32.DM is really tested or used anymore)
If you are using one of the other compilers, substitute the m32.dm
shown throughout with the makefile appropriate to your environment.

M32.DM		Microsoft C 32 bit
M16.DM		Microsoft C 16 bit
B16.DM		Borland C 16 bit  (requires tasm.exe - their assembler)
B32.DM		Borland C 32 bit  (requires tasm32.exe - their assembler)
W32.DM		Watcom C 32 bit
S32.DM		Symantec C 32 bit (not tested recently)

M32.dm can be substitutied with the above if necessary, type:
(Note: the case does matter.)

	dmake -f m32.dm all-scratch

The system is now built.

The system has two major parts; the language, and the windows
development system.  At this point the language portion of the system
is built in the portable mode.  You can test it by going into
examples\exam03, building and running the example using the following
commands:

	cd examples\exam03
	dmake -f m32.dm
	main


--------------------

Building in the faster mode for 32 bit Windows.

Under 32 bit Windows the system includes an assembler dispatcher that
will speed things up.  This does not work on 64 bit builds, but the
system operates fine with or without this step.

If you are performing a 32 bit build you could follow the following
steps to enable the assembler dispatcher.  The system works equally
well with or without this code.

	dmake -f m32.dm STRAT=-S1 newgens
	dmake -f m32.dm realclean
	dmake -f m32.dm all-scratch

--------------------

Building the Windows Development System

This step is only necessary if you want to use the Windows Development
System portion of the system.  The language portion is independent of
this.

If you now want to build the GUI library use the following.  This can
only be done after the above steps were followed (although switching
to STRAT=-S1, the fater mode doesn't matter.  It works either way.)

	dmake -f m32.dm wds-makegens
	dmake -f m32.dm wds-all-scratch
	cd WinExam\setup
	m32dm

You can test the GUI system as follows:

	cd WinExam\exam10
	dmake -f m32.dm
	main

--------------------

Learning the system

After you have everything built and setup you may want to go to
examples\exam01 through examples\exam38 (in order) and see the readme
file for the Dynace language examples and tutorial.

You can also go to
WinExam\exam01 through WinExam\exam25 (in order) and see the readme
file for the GUI Development System / ODBC examples and tutorial.


The complete manuals in PDF format are in the "manual" directory.

--------------------

Resource Editor

The cld directory contains a GUI dialog designer which produces a
custom resource editor which is loaded at runtime by this system.  To
build use:

	cd cld
	dmake -f m32.dm

--------------------


Setup for normal, day-to-day use of the system

You may want to do the following:

Add DR\include to your compiler's include search path
Add DR\lib to your linker's library search path



================================================================================

Linux, Apple Mac, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Cygwin under Windows
------------------------------------------------------------

GNU-make, bash and gcc are assumed.

1.  You can type the following lines in order to remove the .unx file
extension from all makefiles and negate the need for "-f makefile.unx"
This only need be done once.

	chmod 755 dropunx.sh
	./dropunx.sh

2.  Then, build the system as follows:

	make

	(use the following under Cygwin instead)
		make CYGWIN=1

At this point the language portion of the system is built in the
portable mode.  You can test it by going into examples/exam03,
building and running the example using the following commands:

	cd examples/exam03
	make
	./main

--------------------

Building in the faster mode (for 32 bit Linux only)

If you are operating under a 32 bit Linux/Unix you should be able to
rebuild using the faster mode which relies on an assembler piece.
This does not work on 64 bit builds, but the system operates fine
in 32 or 64 bit mode without this step.

If you have any trouble with this step, you should erase everything,
re unpack the distribution, rebuild, and skip this step.  It is not
needed.

If you are performing a 32 bit build you could follow the following
steps to enable the assembler dispatcher. 

To do this just type the following commands (after the above build):

(Cygwin: all make commands, add CYGWIN=1 to the make command line
     Also:  use jumpto.s5 instead of jumpto.s4 below)

	cd back to the root of the Dynace tree
	make STRAT=-S1 newgens
	make realclean
	Edit kernel/makefile to enable the inclusion of JUMPTO
	  (uncomment by removing the # before JUMPTO)

At this point you must copy the appropriate assembler code for your
architecture.  From within the kernel/jumpto directory you must copy
one of the jumpto.* files into jumpto.s It remains in the same
directory.  Choose one of the following:

	jumpto.s6	32 bit Linux using GCC 4.7
	
Now go back to the root of the Dynace tree and type:

	make


You should then clean and re-run the example program as follows:

	cd examples/exam03
	make clean
	make
	./main

If you have any trouble linking it may be due to a different version of
GCC.  You may want to try a different jumpto assembler piece.  See
kernel/makefile.unx  and  kernel/jumpto/*
That directory contains jumpto assembler routines for several machines.

--------------------

Building the Windows Development System (utilizing Wine - the Win32
API for Linux / Unix / Mac)

Naturally, you should have Wine installed on the system first.  You
will want the development libraries portion too.

If you now want to build the GUI library under WINE use the following.
This can only be done after the above steps were followed (although
switching to STRAT=-S1 doesn't matter.  It works either way.)

Make sure the WINEINCPATH is setup correctly in makefile.inc

	cd back to the root of the Dynace tree
	make WINE=1 newgens
	make WINE=1

You can test the GUI system as follows:

	cd WinExam/exam10
	make
	./main

================================================================================

Plan 9
-----

Just go into the main directory and type:

	mk

This will build the entire system.  You can check it by typing:

	cd examples/exam03
	mk
	main

================================================================================

Minix

This was done on Minix 3.2.1

To build under Minix you should follow the same instructions listed
under the section labeled Linux, Apple Mac, etc. except for what
follows in this section.

gmake is required.  Use gmake in all places where make is shown.

The system works with GCC or CLANG.  The system is setup to build
with gcc by default.  You must change makefile.inc (not makefile)
at the top level to switch from gcc to cc.  So, to change from gcc
to clang, change makefile.inc from:

    CC = gcc

to:

    CC = cc


Lastly, all of the makefiles for the example programs (under the
examples directory) use gcc by default.  You would have to change
each one as you use them (from gcc to cc) if you want to use clang.



================================================================================
